# VALIDATED Verizon Media Data Leak - PII & PHI
# Verizon insists this is not a vulnerability, yet the CDN the content is being served from has No SSL cert
# The endpoints leak PII, PHI, Tax information, personal medical data and so much more. 
#
# UPDATE!!!!! BUGCROWD CONFIRMS VERIZON DATA LEAK!!!!! 
#
# I WAS JUST RECENTLY BANNED FROM BUGCROWD WHEN I HAVE NOT HACKED ON THEIR PLATFORM FOR ALMOST A YEAR, 
# BUG CROWD SAID THAT I LEAKED PII AND SENSATIVE INFORMATION AND EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT DO ANYTHING ON THEIR PLATFORM THEY BANNED ME EITHER WAY. 

# WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THEY SAY I LEAKED PII AND SENSATIVE INFORMATION
# If there was no vulnerability, why would I be banned?
#
# CWE-200 Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor
# CWE-359 Exposure of private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
# CWE-213 Exposure of sensitive information due to incompatible polices
#
#
# So what is really going on here?!!!! Why am I being banned in this community, and being validated at the same time? 
# Why is bugcrowd acknowledging PII and sensative information, but yet knows my report was only informational!
# 
#
# This leaking data is coming from Yahoo Business Servers - This is CUSTOMER DATA VALIDATED by VERIZON
# Yahoo Small Business Privacy Policy States That This Data Is Secured! -

## Included
- Samples of Redacted screenshots of endpoints containing PII & PHI
- Full report (redacted for privacy) with validation from Verizon Media Triage team that the Data Leak Exists 
- Email from Hackerone.com kicking me off of the platform for whistleblowing

> ### There are not just 1 or 2 documents, there are countless amounts of documents, ranging from 2000-2021

> ##### I will share unredacted endpoints and documents with journalists ONLY, these are real people, and I will not expose them even more than they already are. 
> ##### I am not looking for a reward, I do not expect a bounty

### I want accountability, and I want a full audit on all Verizon Servers so we can stop the data leak before it gets worse
