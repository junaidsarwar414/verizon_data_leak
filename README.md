## Included
- Samples of Redacted screenshots of endpoints containing PII & PHI
- Full report (redacted for privacy) with validation from Verizon Media Triage team that the Data Leak Exists 
- Email from Hackerone.com kicking me off of the platform for whistleblowing

> ### There are not just 1 or 2 documents, there are countless amounts of documents, ranging from 2000-2021

> ##### I will share unredacted endpoints and documents with journalists ONLY, these are real people, and I will not expose them even more than they already are. 
> ##### I am not looking for a reward, I do not expect a bounty

### I want accountability, and I want a full audit on all Verizon Servers so we can stop the data leak before it gets worse
